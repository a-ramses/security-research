# How to Contribute

This project is not a standard project. We do not have releases and
there do not expect to have a regular updating schedule as we use this
to mostly post security advisories pertaining to security research.

That being said, we do expect to have proof-of-concept code accompanying
those advisories from time to time. These will certainly, at some point,
need patching, so we welcome contributions for those. There are just a
few small guidelines you need to follow.
